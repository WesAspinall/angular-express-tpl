##About
- Includes a few sample controllers, services, and directives as an example of the code organization 
- Follows the best practices and conventions expressed in the ever popular style guides of [John Papa] and [Todd Motto]
- Based on the gulp workflow taught [Tim Whitacre] and [JD Isaacks] at the Iron Yard - Atl (Sept '15)
- Provides a tests.js mapped to the `spec` directory set up for use with `Mocha` and `Chai`
- `express`and a simple `server.js` is included to make requests to your api

##Usage
1. From the command Line:
  * `git clone https://github.com/waspnx/angular-express-tpl.git` 
  * `gulp serve-client` (serves the `/app` directory at `localhost: 8000`)
  * `gulp serve-express` (serves `server.js` at `localhost: 7000`)
  * `gulp start` (serves both the client and server code)

2. ESLint settings are currently set to 4 space indentations as well other various settings. Configure your preference via `.eslintrc`.

3. The `import` statement is used to import functions, objects or primitives that have been exported from an external module, another script, etc.
